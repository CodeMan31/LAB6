Introduction to gpiozero
1 - Distance Sensor - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw8V3-hEF1o
Succesfully integrated distance sensor with raspi. The distance of the nearest object is printed to the console to many decimal places. Also added an LED when the object got within half of a meter of the sensor. This could act as an alarm to detect objects that are too close.

2 - Sound Generator 
I don't if this worked or not on my pi. I think the code was fine and the wav files were named properly but I got no sound from the pi. I tried with bluetooth, usb speaker, and the remote desktop, but no sound would come out. I also verified by trying to listen to a video via youtube but this did't produce sound either. I concluded that it was the pi and not the code, but to be sure I'd have to run the same code on my desktop.

3 - new program - Selectable Servo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65oz15NUQys
I used two buttons to control the position of a servo. I could imagine this being implemented in an embedded system where you needed a physical component to be in three different states. Maybe for camera mouning, robotic arm control, or maybe a door if it were a larger servo.
